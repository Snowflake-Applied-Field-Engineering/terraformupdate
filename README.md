# Snowflake Terraform Provider Upgrade Tool

A  toolkit to help you upgrade your existing Snowflake Terraform configurations from older provider versions to the latest version (v0.94+). This tool is specifically designed for teams who already have Terraform managing their Snowflake infrastructure and need to migrate to newer provider versions.

## Why This Tool?
This is mostly a list of tools and scripts that the AFE team has put together helping customers thru upgrades. We publish this here as a way to share that knowledge. This isn't meant to replace any offical documenation, just some lessons we've learned along the way.
The Snowflake Terraform provider has undergone significant breaking changes, especially with:
- **Bundle 2025_04** - Major grant system overhaul
- **v0.90.x+** - Deprecated legacy grant resources
- **v0.80.x+** - Resource attribute changes

If you're using provider versions older than v0.90.0, you'll need to migrate your existing Terraform code. This tool helps you:

1. **Identify** what needs to change in your existing configuration
2. **Understand** the breaking changes and new patterns
3. **Migrate** your code with step-by-step instructions
4. **Validate** that your migration was successful

## Quick Start - Assess Your Current Setup

### Step 1: Run the Migration Checker

Copy the `migration_checker.sh` script to your existing Terraform directory and run it:

```bash
# Copy the script to your Terraform directory
cp migration_checker.sh /path/to/your/terraform/directory/
cd /path/to/your/terraform/directory/

# Run the checker
./migration_checker.sh
```

This will scan your existing Terraform configuration and state files to identify:
- Deprecated grant resources that need migration
- Old warehouse size formats
- Hardcoded passwords
- Other compatibility issues

### Step 2: Review Your Migration Path

Based on your current provider version, follow the appropriate upgrade path:

| Current Version | Recommended Path | Complexity | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|------------|-------|
| v0.70.x or older | v0.70 → v0.80 → v0.90 → v1.0 → v2.0+ | Very High | Multiple breaking changes |
| v0.80.x | v0.80 → v0.90 → v1.0 → v2.0+ | High | Grant system overhaul |
| v0.90.x | v0.90 → v1.0 → v2.0+ | Medium | Major version transitions |
| v1.x (1.0-1.9) | v1.x → v2.0+ | Medium | v2.0 has breaking changes |
| v2.0-2.2 | v2.0-2.2 → v2.3+ | Low | BCR compatibility fixes |
| v2.3+ | Stay current | Low | Keep updating regularly |

**Important**: 
- Do not skip major versions (0.x → 1.x → 2.x)
- Version 1.0+ introduced significant grant system changes
- Version 2.0+ is the current major version
- Version 2.3+ includes BCR bundle compatibility fixes

### Step 3: Follow the Upgrade Guide

## Prerequisites

- Existing Snowflake Terraform configuration (any version)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.5.0
- Snowflake account with appropriate permissions (ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN role)
- Access to your Terraform state files
- Backup capabilities for your state files

## Common Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: You have old grant resources

**Problem**: Your configuration uses deprecated grant resources like:
```hcl
resource "snowflake_database_grant" "grant" {
  database_name = "MY_DATABASE"
  privilege     = "USAGE"
  roles         = ["MY_ROLE"]
}
```

**Solution**: See [MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md](MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md#grant-migrations) for step-by-step migration to:
```hcl
resource "snowflake_grant_privileges_to_role" "database_usage" {
  role_name  = "MY_ROLE"
  privileges = ["USAGE"]
  on_database = "MY_DATABASE"
}
```

### Scenario 2: Warehouse size format errors

**Problem**: Terraform plan shows errors about warehouse sizes:
```
Error: Invalid warehouse size "XSMALL"
```

**Solution**: Update to hyphenated format:
```hcl
warehouse_size = "X-SMALL"  # Changed from "XSMALL"
```

### Scenario 3: Provider version conflicts

**Problem**: Getting errors after updating provider version

**Solution**: Follow the incremental upgrade path in [UPGRADE_GUIDE.md](UPGRADE_GUIDE.md#step-by-step-upgrade-process)

## Understanding BCR Bundles

Snowflake releases **Behavior Change Release (BCR) Bundles** that contain breaking changes. These changes are eventually enabled by default and cannot be disabled. Our [BCR_BUNDLE_GUIDE.md](BCR_BUNDLE_GUIDE.md) helps you:

- Understand what each bundle changes
- Test bundles before they're enforced
- Migrate your Terraform code to be compatible
- Handle authentication policies, privileges, and resource changes

**Key BCR Bundles:**
- **2025_06**: Authentication policy changes (MFA methods deprecated)
- **2025_05**: Key-pair auth changes, dependency enforcement
- **2025_04**: MFA defaults, stage access requirements
- **2025_03**: Privilege renames, Python package changes

See [BCR_BUNDLE_GUIDE.md](BCR_BUNDLE_GUIDE.md) for detailed migration instructions.

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### Phase 1: Assessment (5-10 minutes)

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Snowflake-Applied-Field-Engineering/terraformupdate.git
   cd terraformupdate
   ```

2. **Copy migration checker to your Terraform directory**
   ```bash
   cp migration_checker.sh /path/to/your/terraform/
   cd /path/to/your/terraform/
   ```

3. **Run the assessment**
   ```bash
   ./migration_checker.sh
   ```

4. **Review the output** - The script will tell you:
   - How many deprecated resources you have
   - What configuration changes are needed
   - Recommended next steps

### Phase 2: Preparation (10-15 minutes)

1. **Backup your state file**
   ```bash
   # Local state
   cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup
   
   # Remote state (example for S3)
   aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket/path/terraform.tfstate ./terraform.tfstate.backup
   ```

2. **Document current state**
   ```bash
   terraform state list > resources_before_migration.txt
   terraform show > state_before_migration.txt
   ```

3. **Export current grants from Snowflake**
   ```bash
   # For each role you manage
   snowsql -q "SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE YOUR_ROLE;" -o output_format=csv > grants_before.csv
   ```

4. **Review the upgrade guide**
   - Read [UPGRADE_GUIDE.md](UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) for your version
   - Check [MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md](MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md) for similar patterns

### Phase 3: Migration (30-60 minutes)

Follow the detailed instructions in [UPGRADE_GUIDE.md](UPGRADE_GUIDE.md#step-by-step-upgrade-process) which covers:

1. **Update provider version** (incrementally)
2. **Remove deprecated resources from state**
3. **Update configuration files** with new resource types
4. **Import new resources** into state
5. **Validate with terraform plan**
6. **Apply changes**

### Phase 4: Validation (10-15 minutes)

1. **Verify no unexpected changes**
   ```bash
   terraform plan  # Should show no changes
   ```

2. **Compare grants in Snowflake**
   ```bash
   snowsql -q "SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE YOUR_ROLE;" -o output_format=csv > grants_after.csv
   diff grants_before.csv grants_after.csv
   ```

3. **Test functionality**
   - Connect with affected roles
   - Verify database/schema/warehouse access
   - Run sample queries

## Detailed Documentation

## Reference Configurations

The following files provide reference examples of modern Terraform configurations using the latest provider version (v2.3+):

- `examples_main.tf` - Example resource definitions using current best practices
- `examples_variables.tf` - Variable patterns for v2.3+
- `examples_outputs.tf` - Useful outputs for Snowflake resources
- `examples_terraform.tfvars` - Configuration example
- `versions.tf` - Provider version constraints (shows v2.3+ recommended)

These are provided as **reference only** to show you what your migrated code should look like. **Do not replace your existing configuration with these files.** Use them as a guide when updating your own Terraform code.

## Key Breaking Changes to Know

### Grant System Overhaul (v0.90+)

The biggest change is how grants are managed. The old pattern used separate resources for each object type:

**Old (Deprecated):**
- `snowflake_database_grant`
- `snowflake_schema_grant`
- `snowflake_warehouse_grant`
- `snowflake_table_grant`
- `snowflake_view_grant`

**New (Current):**
- `snowflake_grant_privileges_to_role` - Unified grant resource

See [MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md](MIGRATION_EXAMPLES.md) for detailed before/after examples.

### Warehouse Size Format (v0.80+)

Warehouse sizes now require hyphens:
- Old: `XSMALL`, `XXSMALL`
- New: `X-SMALL`, `XX-SMALL`

### Provider Configuration (v0.90+)

Provider authentication parameter changed:
- Old: `username`
- New: `user`

## Migration Best Practices

1. **Never Skip Versions**: Upgrade incrementally through each major version
2. **Always Backup State**: Before any migration, backup your state file
3. **Test in Non-Production**: Run migration in dev/staging first
4. **Validate Grants**: Compare grants before and after migration
5. **Use the Checker Script**: Run `migration_checker.sh` before starting
6. **Document Your Changes**: Keep notes on what you migrated
7. **Plan Multiple Times**: Run `terraform plan` after each step
8. **One Resource Type at a Time**: Migrate database grants, then schema grants, etc.

## Useful Migration Commands

```bash
# Check what needs migration
./migration_checker.sh

# Backup state
cp terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup

# List all current resources
terraform state list

# Remove deprecated resource from state
terraform state rm snowflake_database_grant.old_grant

# Import new grant resource
terraform import snowflake_grant_privileges_to_role.new_grant "ROLE|false|false|USAGE|OnDatabase|DB_NAME"

# Validate migration
terraform plan

# Show specific resource
terraform state show snowflake_grant_privileges_to_role.new_grant
```

## Common Migration Errors and Solutions

### Error: "Resource not found"
**Cause**: Resource was removed from state but still exists in Snowflake  
**Solution**: Import the resource back into state with correct format

### Error: "Cycle in dependency graph"
**Cause**: Circular dependencies in grant resources  
**Solution**: Use explicit `depends_on` or break into separate apply steps

### Error: "Invalid provider version"
**Cause**: Trying to skip major versions  
**Solution**: Upgrade incrementally (v0.70 → v0.80 → v0.90 → v0.94)

### Error: "Invalid warehouse size"
**Cause**: Using old format without hyphens  
**Solution**: Change `XSMALL` to `X-SMALL`

See [UPGRADE_GUIDE.md](UPGRADE_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting) for more solutions.
